Test_397	Extremely Positive	Today was the most crowded I have ever seen the grocery store during #Covid_19. Maybe people heard the speech last night, and the fact we are waiting for @jaredkushner to gain knowledge on this before Trump proceeds. I take it back, a zombie apocalypse looks better now.
Test_398	Extremely Negative	Genuinely don't understand the point of stockpiling toilet paper. That is literally the last thing I would stockpile. Worst case scenario you just use a towel. Food is what you should be concerned about. ????
Test_399	Extremely Negative	Welp. I?m panicking. Not about the coronavirus. Panicked that stores won?t have food or Tylenol for the kids etc. or that prices will be obscene. Gov needs to protect us from being gouged during this crisis. @PremierScottMoe @JustinTrudeau @SKGov #skpoli #Covid_19 #coronavirus

Test_403	Extremely Negative	I've been to #Costco to grocery shop, it's armageddon, it's panic buying &amp; trolley wars, yet the mood of the store was sedate, no laughter, no talking, just people filling their trolley's to the brim. They had 400 people waiting at the doors this morning, a new record. #Covid_19
Test_404	Positive	In a #CNBCTV18Exclusive chat, Praveer Sinha of Tata Power says #COVID2019 has not affected coal prices https://t.co/8FbFWKc0n5
Test_405	Extremely Negative	If you have a #retail store you need a #cleaning schedule. At #cannarelief #Mississauga we disinfect the payment machines, counters, door handles, several times per day and spray with #Lysol. No one comes to work ill. We have 4 #handsanitizers instore. The new normal. #Covid_19
Test_406	Negative	Not a full 24hrs since Guyana declared its first #Covid_19 case and the nation is panicking. Pharmacies and other sellers of cleaning agents have quadrupled prices. Misinformation is rampant and the public health ministry is not doing enough to bring about a sense of calm.
Test_407	Positive	It was pretty metal at the grocery store today. #Covid_19
Test_408	Negative	Private companies are using the #Covid_19 crises to extort the public. Price-gouging during times of crises is unethical and you as the consumer should take note of who did what in your time of need.
Test_409	Extremely Negative	There was no meat at my local supermarket yesterday and very few packages of pasta. At the end of the day Portugal should be ashamed! This is shameful and this needs to be shown. Again, it's important to be safe from the #Covid_19, but don't panic, that will get us nowhere.

Test_415	Positive	We dont have enough test available. We don't have designated trailers available for quarantine patients. Did you even tell people to save money because the stock market is tanking. And people on self quarantine for two weeks may need assistance for Bill's and food #Covid_19 3/6
Test_416	Negative	The fact that you can't get tested in many places for #Covid_19 without answering yes to "have you been in contact with anyone from China, South Korea, or Italy" is an absurdity. How would you even know? Personally, I don't ask everyone at the grocery store where they've been.

Test_422	Extremely Positive	3h into the #Norway - #Covid_19 shutdown. I get to the store to grab some milk. There are a billion cars outside the little grocery store and people are freaking out inside, buying everything between heaven and earth. Best thing is -the grocery stores aren't even shutting down.
Test_423	Extremely Negative	This #CoronavirusPandemic is having a drastic effect on the sick and elderly. No-one wants to visit them.

Test_426	Extremely Positive	During the #covid_19 bubble times, the best investment is flight tickets. Just have a look at the prices.
Test_427	Extremely Negative	US consumer prices unexpectedly rose in February but could drop in months ahead as COVID-19 depresses demand for some goods &amp; services, outweighing price increases related to shortages caused by disruptions to supply chain. https://t.co/ta4GzWk3nx

Test_430	Positive	Now is the time for @netflix @PrimeVideo and others to lower their prices and get some new people in. Be forthcoming in this time of recommended social distancing. It will be a smart "investment" in the long run. #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 #Netflix #PrimeVideo
Test_431	Negative	@shereka45482005 @JamaicaObserver Hope they also limiting the how they hike up the prices of products that are currently in demand ? twice and three times the original price is not beneficial to all in a crisis situation. Spare a thought for those who wil
Test_432	Positive	My local supermarket looks like it's been looted with how people are panic buying over #Covid_19. Calm down. Shops aren't closing down, they're still gonna be supplied.

Test_438	Extremely Negative	To those of us who find a stocked supermarket &amp; can afford it: please buy dried &amp; tinned food &amp; long life milk to put in the foodbank basket. Foodbanks &amp; their clients are suffering. Hoarding leads to the greedy taking food from the poorest.#Covid_19

Test_441	Extremely Negative	Trump's bumbling teleprompter reading did not instill confidence. The American people are panicking. Grocery store was MUCH busier than normal for a Thursday afternoon. Cashier said it had been going on all day. Gas station busy. It will only get worse. #TrumpResign #Covid_19
Test_442	Negative	Before the coronavirus is too severe where you live, do these things: - Stock up on food - Get your annual health exam - Get your taxes done - Keep your gas tank on full - Buy a few pocket sanitizers Be a safe citizen. Try to stay home if you have a cold or flu. #Covid_19
Test_443	Extremely Negative	Hi everyone. If you are panic buying and ending up with more than you need, you should think about returning it. Many of us haven't been so selfish and now can't buy toilet roll or dry food at all #Covid_19

Test_453	Extremely Negative	I need people to be less stupid about COVID-19. No, you do not need to stock up on TP or bottled water. Personally, I'll be buying some extra food that'll keep a while (canned, frozen, dry goods, etc.) and OTC and prescription meds that might run out if I'm quarantined. *shrug*
Test_454	Neutral	Dear General Public. PLEASE stop stockpiling food for the unlikely event you?re prohibited to leave your home. You?re making it hard for everyone to eat/drink affordably today and putting extra pressure on businesses and suppliers to keep up with demand. @WholeFoods #coronavirus

Test_878	Extremely Positive	Stock up on food and water just to be safe folks. Covid-19 isn?t deadly, but it has a chance to disrupt food supply chains. Humans are nine meals away from anarchy; you do not want to be in the streets at that time. Buy a gun to protect you and yours. Be prepared, just in case
Test_879	Extremely Positive	I work at a small local grocery store and news just hit that they're shutting schools down for three weeks. Please have patience with your cashiers, baggers, and stock people. We are trying the best we can to keep up. #Covid_19
Test_880	Extremely Positive	It'll be interesting to see how retail stores react to covid-19. Do they take a short term profit loss by closing, or do they risk a PR nightmare and long term profit and consumer trust loss by potentially having an outbreak start in their store?
