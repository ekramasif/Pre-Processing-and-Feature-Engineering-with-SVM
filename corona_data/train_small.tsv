Now, they expect taxpayers to bail them out to the tune of $50 billion. It's the same old story.
Train_2193	Positive	Amazon -- the richest corporation in the world, which paid almost no taxes last year -- is offering UNPAID time off for workers who are sick and just 2 weeks paid leave for workers who test positive for the virus. Meanwhile, it demands mandatory overtime. Shame on Jeff Bezos.
